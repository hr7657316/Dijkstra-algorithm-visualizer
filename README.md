Dijkstra Algorithm Visualizer
Description
The Dijkstra Algorithm Visualizer is a web application that visually demonstrates the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm on a grid. Users can set start and end points, add obstacles, and see the algorithm in action, finding the shortest path between the two points. The visualizer also offers a ripple mode for an alternative visual effect.

Features
Interactive Grid: Users can interact with the grid to set start and end points and draw obstacles.
Visualization Controls: Start the visualization, refresh the grid, and enable/disable ripple mode.
Speed Control: Adjust the animation speed (Fast, Medium, Slow).
Sound Effects: Audio feedback for starting and completing the visualization.
Installation
No installation is required. Simply open the index.html file in a modern web browser.

Usage
Open the Application:

Open index.html in your browser.
Set Start and End Points:

Click on a cell to set the start point (red).
Click on another cell to set the end point (teal).
Draw Obstacles:

Click and drag over cells to create obstacles (dark gray).
Control the Visualization:

Use the buttons to start the visualization, refresh the grid, and enable/disable ripple mode.
Adjust the speed using the dropdown menu.
Start Visualization:

Click the "Start" button to run the Dijkstra algorithm and visualize the shortest path.
